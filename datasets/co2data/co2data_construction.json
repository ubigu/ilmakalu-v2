In Finland, as well as in the other Nordic countries, the manufacturing of bitumen waterproofing almost exclusively uses bitumen modified with SBS (styrene-butadiene-styrene). Using<br \/>\r\nSBS makes the bitumen elastic which increases its resistance to temperature changes, and most importantly in Finnish climate, cold.<br \/>\r\nIn Finland, the supporting structure is generally made of polyester or glass fibre. <br \/>\r\nMost of the emissions of bitumen waterproofing come from the manufacturing of raw materials, specifically bitumen, SBS and the supporting polyester or glass fibre. Manufacturing electricity and heat used in the heating of bitumen and other production processes also have a significant impact on the emissions of the products.<br \/>\r\nSignificant differences arise mainly from the amounts of bitumen and the SBS used in the products.<br \/>\r\nBitumen roofing products are divided into three different main categories: bottom layer membranes, top layer membranes and single-ply roofing system.

The specific emissions for biofuels were formulated by using the same factors as was used for chips for in the connection of emission-assessment of electricity and district heat.

The CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass were calculated as zero emissions. The influence of harvesting of biomass on carbon sinks of forests or soil was not considered.<br \/>\r\nThe emission values were also assessed for energy services for coming decades considering the targeted decarbonization of energy services.  The applied assumptions are based on the basic scenario for 2020 \u2013 2050 presented by VTT and SYKE in PITKO project (Long-term emission trends) documentation.<br \/>\r\nGHGs of fossil fuels for building heating in decentralized systems were assessed for light heating oil considering the emissions caused by procurement and construction of infra in addition to combustion.  The specific emissions for biofuels were formulated by using the same factors as was used for chips for in the connection of emission-assessment of electricity and district heat. The assessed emissions because of transportation and manufacturing were added following the principles of EU REDII Directive (EU 2018).

The CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass were calculated as zero emissions. The influence of harvesting of biomass on carbon sinks of forests or soil was not considered.<br \/>\r\nThe emission values were also assessed for energy services for coming decades considering the targeted decarbonization of energy services.  The applied assumptions are based on the basic scenario for 2020 \u2013 2050 presented by VTT and SYKE in PITKO project (Long-term emission trends) documentation.<br \/>\r\nGHGs of fossil fuels for building heating in decentralized systems were assessed for light heating oil considering the emissions caused by procurement and construction of infra in addition to combustion.  The specific emissions for biofuels were formulated by using the same factors as was used for chips for in the connection of emission-assessment of electricity and district heat. The assessed emissions because of transportation and manufacturing were added following the principles of EU REDII Directive (EU 2018). The specific emission factors for fossil fuels and biofuels for decentralized heating of buildings were assumed to remain unchanged throughout the period considered.<br \/>\r\n",

Thus the representativeness of the European value is quite good.  <br \/>\r\nPIR and PUR insulations are both PU based insulations. <br \/>\r\nThe main raw materials of polyurethane are isocyanate, polyol and propellants. In addition, various additives are used to control the chemical reaction or to alter the properties of polyurethane. After mixing the raw materials, heat is released in the chemical reaction resulting in the gasification of the propellant and expanding the volume of the mixture. The resulting insulation material consists of small cells containing gas or air. PIR insulation is chemically modified from polyurethane to contain more isocyanate.  By increasing the temperature of the manufacturing process, the reactions of polyol and isosyate can go further, increasing the heat resistance of the insulation.<br \/>\r\nPIR insulation panels are covered on both sides with aluminium foil or other laminate. <br \/>\r\n",

This assessment was supplemented by VTT calculations for products, which were not included in the EPD project.  In the latter case, the applied approach was different, as the GWP values were calculated according to the defined concrete recipes, transportation distances, and energy consumption representing Finnish production conditions and with using GWP data of this database (such as natural aggregates, electricity and district heat etc.).
